        Number using O5 output only:             0
        Number using O5 and O6:                  0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,905
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           647 out of   3,905   16%
    Number with an unused LUT:               2,134 out of   3,905   54%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,124 out of   3,905   28%
    Number of unique control sets:             151
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             491 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
